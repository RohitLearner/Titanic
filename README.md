Getting started with competitive data science can be quite intimidating. So I build this notebook for quick overview on `Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster` competition.
For your convenience, please view it in [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/iamrohitsingh/titanic-visualization-prediction/).

I encourage you to fork this kernel/GitHub repo, play with the code and enter the competition. Good luck!

## Requirements

This project requires  **Python 2.7**  and the following Python libraries installed:

-   [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
-   [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
-   [seaborn](https://stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/#)
-   [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
-   [XGBoost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
-  [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)

You will also need to have the software installed to run and execute an  [iPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

## Code

An ipython notebook is used for data preprocessing, feature transforming and outlier detecting. All core scripts are in `file .ipynb"` folder. All input data are in `input` folder and the detailed description of the data can be found in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data).

## Key features of the model training process

K Fold Cross Validation: Using 5-fold cross-validation.

First Level Learning Model: On each run of cross-validation tried fitting following models :-
1. Random Forest classifier
2. Extra Trees classifier
3. AdaBoost classifer
4. Gradient Boosting classifer
5. Support Vector Machine

Second Level Learning Model : Trained a XGBClassifier using xgboost

The final price prediction for each house is present in the `output` folder as a .csv file. The final model used for scoring is hypertuned XGBoost Classifier with Cross Validation. 

The final XGBoost Classifier can be viewed as :
